# springbtcontentdiversity

Migrated and converted source code for blogs and blogger content distribution and analysis.


You will have to have blogger name added to your LDA class property so it can not only compute for blogs but also for blogger. i.e a user can query the pre-computed script where a blogger name matches. 

It is used the topic distribution data to compute for Novelty, Resonance and Transcience.


This is inspired and created from the great research work of Dr. Zach of COMOS UALR who is now a Professor at UCA.
